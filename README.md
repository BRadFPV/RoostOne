# RoostOne Freestyle Drone Frame

I couldn't resist combining the best! Introducing the RoostOne... a Rooster camera cage meshed with 18mm of slammed Source One goodness. I love the feel of the almost true X and tight CG.

Currently the top plate has been widened by 2mm to mesh with the Titanium front end and the trunk extended by 5mm for better mounting options (dji). It might be possible to re-cut a V3 frame by using a different camera and mount. Still a work in progress ðŸ™‚

The RoostOne is fully proven. I've bando bashed it for 2 months and have had NO issue with the cam cage! Only one broken arm. Super happy with it's durability as compared to the Rooster. I've broken many dozens of rooster arms in 3 years. IMO their small contact area and bolt placement is way inferior to the SO. There's so much more carbon surface to absorb impacts and no straight body edge to act as a fulcrum. The contact surface on SO arm is nearly 860mm/sq vs 150mm/sq on the Rooster (without a sandwich plate). Please check out my latest YT videos. They were flown with the RoostOne V3.
